    "Over the past few months, the number of referral cases at the Anderson Cancer Center has been growing rapidly. In order to provide a comprehensive and integrated health service for the people,the center has identified the need for using data to diagnose this growth, and to communicate the findings to simulate donor funding. This study aims to develop a model that will aid the center in addressing the growing number of referrals and identify the key variables that will appeal to donor funding."

    "#### c). An Overview of PCA\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that is used to reduce the number of dimensions in a large dataset while retaining the original information. The \"Curse of Dimensionality\" is a common problem in machine learning. Many dimensions in a dataset often lead to overfitting (where a model fits too closely) and or multicollinearity (where variables are related, affecting model performance). PCA irons out these problems by extracting the most informative features from large datasets while preserving the most relevant information from the initial dataset (https://www.ibm.com/topics/principal-component-analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "This statistical technique involves both linear algebra and matrix operations, and it transforms the original dataset into a new coordinate system that is structured by the principal components. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues from the covariance matrix that underpin the principal components allow for the analysis of these linear transformations.\n",
